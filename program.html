		<h1>Program Development</h1>
    <p>I have helped the Vanderbilt German Department dramatically expand its extracurricular offerings,
    particularly focusing on activities of interest to undergraduates. I established a new Friday evening
    conversation event ("Stammtisch") that has been highly successful with undergraduate and graduate students
    alike, and cofounded the German Department Visual Culture Seminar. Tasked with organizing the first Gisela
    Mosig Lecture Series, I developed a format in which the three visiting speakers would conduct a graduate
    workshop and separately give a lecture explicitly intended to be of interest to an undergraduate audience,
    and these lectures - on German Comic Books, Stefan Zweig, and Black German Fiction - saw unprecedented
    attendance both of undergraduate students and members of the public. I also led efforts to organize the TN-AATGs annual Fr&uumlhlingsfest event at Vanderbilt in 2017.
	In 2017, I received the <strong>Gisela Mosig Award for Outstanding Service</strong> from the Vanderbilt German Department.</p>
