		<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Beyond German-language rap and <strong>popular music</strong>, my research focuses on <strong>media studies and digital humanities</strong>, <strong>environmental humanities</strong>, <strong>applied linguistics</strong>, and <strong>German and Austrian literature from early romanticism until the present</strong>. My work has been supported by a <strong>Digital Humanities Fellowship</strong> from the <strong>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</strong>, and an <strong>Ernst Mach Fellowship</strong> from the <strong>Austrian Exchange Service (OeAD)</strong>. I have reviewed books on Austrian Studies and Media Studies for the Journal of Austrian Studies and the German Studies Review.</p>

		<h2>Dissertation</h2>

		<p><strong>The Poetic Loop: Austrian Music and Sonic Reproducibility</strong></p>
		<p>My dissertation analyzes Austrian rap music as an example of poetry in the age of its sonic reproducibility, showing
		how the aesthetic innovations of 70s DJs in the South Bronx continue to influence both the music and texts of contemporary
		rap songs, and how these aesthetics are intertwined with the epistemology of the internet age. I emphasize the special
		qualities of Austrian rap in contrast to rap from Germany, discussing not only cultural
		and linguistic differences, but also the significance of Austria's political neutrality. Without the presence of American
		military personnel, early Austrian hip-hop practitioners could make no claims to an <q>authentic</q> connection to a non-mediated
		hip-hop scene, thus making Austria a particularly clear example of artists constructing new and meaningful works from the
		detritus of the culture industry. An example, in other words, with relevance to the aesthetic situation of hip-hop in other
		countries, and indeed, to the situation of much of human culture in the 21st century. <a href="https://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu//available/etd-03222018-094646/">Read it here. </a></p>
