		<h1>Ted Dawson</h1>

		<h3>Assistant Professor of Practice, University of Nebraska-Lincoln</h3>
		<img class="profile" src="square-ted-dawson.jpg" alt="Ted Dawson Headshot"/>

		<p>I teach Austrian and German literature and culture from the 19th century to
			the present, focusing especially on environmental humanities, digital humanities, and sound and media studies. I also direct the German MA program at UNL, and am a faculty affiliate in the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities.
			Before coming to Nebraska, I was Visiting Assistant Profesor at the University of Maryland, where I helped
			establish an interdisciplinary environmental humanities research community. <br/><br/>
			I have published on Austrian rap music, multilingualism in German studies, the emerging field of EcoDH / environmental digital humanities, and Austrian author Christoph Ransmayr as poet of the Anthropocene.
			I have taught a wide variety of German language and culture courses, and particularly enjoy teaching German and Austrian literature of the environment and German vocal music from Schubert to hip-hop.
			The four years I've spent researching and teaching in Austria and Germany have been almost exclusively spent in cities beginning with the letter &quotW&quot (at least in German): W&uumlrzburg, Wiesbaden, and above all, Wien (Vienna).</p>
