		<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>Before coming to Nebraska, I taught as visiting assistant professor at the University of Maryland.
	I have taught a wide variety of courses, including elementary to advanced language classes,
	an upper division/graduate seminar on various singing traditions in German culture, and
	an English language class on German conceptions of nature from romanticism to the present.
	During my time as doctoral student at Vanderbilt, I team taught a course on post-war short fiction with second-Language
	literacy expert Per Urlaub, and also TA'd for lecture courses on German Fairy Tales, Nazi Cinema, 20th Century European Culture, and Film & Media Studies.
	My teaching has been recognized by a number of awards, including a 2016 HASTAC scholarship to lead a working group on ecocritical digital humanities at the Vanderbilt Digital Humanities Center,
	the 2015 Philip Rhein Award for Graduate Teaching Excellence in the Vanderbilt German Department,
	and an English Teaching Assistantship through the Austrian Fulbright Commission to spend two years teaching English in Austrian high schools.</p>
